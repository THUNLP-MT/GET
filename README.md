## Cleaned Codes of GET

If you are interested in using GET for other tasks, we have provided a cleaned version in `./get_clean` that can be easily integrated into other projects. The only requirements are:

```bash
torch
torch_scatter
scipy
```

**Example Code**

```python
from get_clean import GET, fully_connect_edges, knn_edges
import torch

# use GPU 0
device = torch.device('cuda:0')

# Dummy model parameters
d_hidden = 64   # hidden size
d_radial = 16   # mapped size of key/value in attention (greatly influence space complexity)
n_channel = 1   # number of channels for coordinates, usually 1 as one atom only has one coordinate
d_edge = 16     # edge feature size
n_rbf = 16      # RBF kernal size
n_head= 4       # number of heads for multi-head attention

# Dummy variables h, x and fully connected edges
# 19 atoms, divided into 8 blocks
block_ids = torch.tensor([0,0,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,4,4,5,6,6,6,6,7,7], dtype=torch.long).to(device)
# 8 blocks, divided into 2 graphs
batch_ids = torch.tensor([0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1], dtype=torch.long).to(device)
n_atoms, n_blocks = block_ids.shape[0], batch_ids.shape[0]
H = torch.randn(n_atoms, d_hidden, device=device)
X = torch.randn(n_atoms, n_channel, 3, device=device)
# fully connect edges
src_dst = fully_connect_edges(batch_ids)
# if you want to test knn_edges, you can try:
# src_dst = knn_edges(block_ids, batch_ids, X, k_neighbors=5)
edge_attr = torch.randn(len(src_dst[0]), d_edge).to(device)

# Initialize GET
model = GET(d_hidden, d_radial, n_channel, n_rbf, d_edge=d_edge, n_head=n_head)
model.to(device)
model.eval()

# Run GET
H, X = model(H, X, block_ids, batch_ids, src_dst, edge_attr)
```

## Setup

### Environment

We have prepared the configuration for creating the environment with conda in *env.yml*:
```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

### Datasets

We assume all the datasets are downloaded to the folder *./datasets*.

#### 1. Protein-Protein Affinity (PPA)

First download and decompress the protein-protein complexes in [PDBbind](http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download.php) (registration is required):

```bash
wget http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download/PDBbind_v2020_PP.tar.gz -P ./datasets/PPA
tar zxvf ./datasets/PPA/PDBbind_v2020_PP.tar.gz -C ./datasets/PPA
rm ./datasets/PPA/PDBbind_v2020_PP.tar.gz
```

Then process the dataset with the provided script:

```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PDBbind_PP.py \
    --index_file ./datasets/PPA/PP/index/INDEX_general_PP.2020 \
    --pdb_dir ./datasets/PPA/PP \
    --out_dir ./datasets/PPA/processed
```

The processed data will be saved to *./datasets/PPA/processed/PDBbind.pkl*. This should result in 2502 valid complexes with affinity labels.

We still need to prepare the test set, i.e. Protein-Protein Affinity Benchmark Version 2. We have provided the index file in *./datasets/PPA/PPAB_V2.csv*, but the structure files need to be downloaded from the [official site](https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/). In case the official site is down, we also uploaded [a backup on Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/8318025/files/benchmark5.5.tgz?download=1).

```bash
# If the offical url is not working, please replace it with https://zenodo.org/record/8318025/files/benchmark5.5.tgz?download=1
wget https://zlab.umassmed.edu/benchmark/benchmark5.5.tgz -O ./datasets/PPA/benchmark5.5.tgz
tar zxvf ./datasets/PPA/benchmark5.5.tgz -C ./datasets/PPA
rm ./datasets/PPA/benchmark5.5.tgz
```

Then process the test set with the provided script:

```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PPAB.py \
    --index_file ./datasets/PPA/PPAB_V2.csv \
    --pdb_dir ./datasets/PPA/benchmark5.5 \
    --out_dir ./datasets/PPA/processed
```

The processed dataset as well as different splits (Rigid/Medium/Flexible/All) will be saved to *./datasets/PPA/processed*. This should result in 176 valid complexes with affinity labels.

#### 2. PDBBind Benchmark (established splits)

First download and extract the raw files:

```bash
mkdir ./datasets/PDBBind
wget "https://zenodo.org/record/8102783/files/pdbbind_raw.tar.gz?download=1" -O ./datasets/PDBBind/pdbbind_raw.tar.gz
tar zxvf ./datasets/PDBBind/pdbbind_raw.tar.gz -C ./datasets/PDBBind
rm ./datasets/PDBBind/pdbbind_raw.tar.gz
```

Then process the dataset with the provided script:
```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PDBbind_benchmark.py \
    --benchmark_dir ./datasets/PDBBind/pdbbind \
    --out_dir ./datasets/PDBBind/processed
```

This should result in 4709 valid complexes with affinity labels.

What is different here is that if you want to use fragment-based representation of small molecules, you need to process the data here:

```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PDBbind_benchmark.py \
    --benchmark_dir ./datasets/PDBBind/pdbbind \
    --fragment PS_300 \
    --out_dir ./datasets/PDBBind/processed_PS_300
```

#### 3. Ligand Binding Affinity (LBA)

You only need to download and decompress the LBA dataset:

```bash
mkdir ./datasets/LBA
wget "https://zenodo.org/record/4914718/files/LBA-split-by-sequence-identity-30.tar.gz?download=1" -O ./datasets/LBA/LBA-split-by-sequence-identity-30.tar.gz
tar zxvf ./datasets/LBA/LBA-split-by-sequence-identity-30.tar.gz -C ./datasets/LBA
rm ./datasets/LBA/LBA-split-by-sequence-identity-30.tar.gz
```

#### 4. Zero-Shot Inference on Nucleic-Acid-Ligand Affinity (NLA)

We need to use protein-protein data, protein-nucleic-acid data, and protein-ligand data for training, then evaluate the zero-shot performance on nucleic-acid-ligand affinity. All the data are extracted from PDBBind database. We have got protein-protein data in PPA and protein-ligand data in LBA, now we further need to get other data.
To get protein-nucleic-acid data:

```bash
wget http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download/PDBbind_v2020_PN.tar.gz -P ./datasets/PN
tar zxvf ./datasets/PN/PDBbind_v2020_PN.tar.gz -C ./datasets
rm ./datasets/PN/PDBbind_v2020_PN.tar.gz
```
Then process the data:

```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PDBbind_PN.py \
    --index_file ./datasets/PN/index/INDEX_general_PN.2020 \
    --pdb_dir ./datasets/PN \
    --out_dir ./datasets/PN/processed
```

This should result in 922 valid complexes with affinity labels.

To get nucleic-acid-ligand data:

```bash
wget http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/download/PDBbind_v2020_NL.tar.gz -P ./datasets/NL
tar zxvf ./datasets/NL/PDBbind_v2020_NL.tar.gz -C ./datasets
rm ./datasets/NL/PDBbind_v2020_NL.tar.gz
```

Then process the data:

```bash
python scripts/data_process/process_PDBbind_NL.py \
    --index_file ./datasets/NL/index/INDEX_general_NL.2020 \
    --pdb_dir ./datasets/NL \
    --out_dir ./datasets/NL/processed
```

This should result in 134 valid complexes with affinity labels.

#### 5 (Optional). Ligand Efficacy Prediction (LEP)

You only need to download and decompress the LEP dataset:

```bash
mkdir ./datasets/LEP
wget "https://zenodo.org/record/4914734/files/LEP-split-by-protein.tar.gz?download=1" -O ./datasets/LEP/LEP-split-by-protein.tar.gz
tar zxvf ./datasets/LEP/LEP-split-by-protein.tar.gz -C ./datasets/LEP
rm ./datasets/LEP/LEP-split-by-protein.tar.gz
```

## Experiments

:warning: Due to the non-deterministic behavior of `torch.scatter`, the reproduced results might not be exactly the same as those reported in the paper, but should be very close to them.

### PDBbind Benchmark

We have provided the script for running the experiment with 3 random seeds:

```bash
python scripts/exps/exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/PDBBind/identity30_get.json \
    --gpus 0
```

### Protein-Protein Affinity (PPA)

We have provided the script for splitting, training and testing with 3 random seeds:

```bash
python scripts/exps/PPA_exps_3.py \
    --pdbbind ./datasets/PPA/processed/PDBbind.pkl \
    --ppab_dir ./datasets/PPA/processed \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/PPA/get.json \
    --gpus 0
```

### Ligand Binding Affinity (LBA)

We have provided the script for training and testing with 3 random seeds:

```bash
python scripts/exps/exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/LBA/get.json \
    --gpus 0
```

If you want to use fragment-based representation of small molecules, please replace the config with `get_ps300.json`.

### Ligand Efficacy Prediction (LEP)

We have provided the script for training and testing with 3 random seeds:

```bash
python scripts/exps/exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/LEP/get.json \
    --gpus 0
```

### Data Augmentation from Different Domains

To enhance the performance on PPA with additional data on LBA:

```bash
python scripts/exps/mix_exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/MIX/get_ppa.json \
    --gpus 0
```

To enhance the performance on LBA with additional data on PPA:

```bash
python scripts/exps/mix_exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/MIX/get_lba.json \
    --gpus 0
```

To enhance the performance on PDBbind with additional data on PPA:

```bash
# !!!Here we use exps_3.py instead of mix_exps_3.py
python scripts/exps/exps_3.py \
    --config ./scripts/exps/configs/MIX/get_pdbbind.json \
    --gpus 0
```


### Zero-Shot on Nucleic Acid and Ligand Affinity

This experiment needs two 12G GPU (so a total of 2000 vertexes in a batch). If you use a single >=24G GPU, please change the value of `max_n_vertex_per_gpu` to 2000.

```bash
python scripts/exps/NL_zeroshot.py \
    --config scripts/exps/configs/NL/get.json \
    --gpu 1 2
```
